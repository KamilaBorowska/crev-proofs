comment: |
  When programming for HermitCore, L4Re, UEFI or SGX on x86_64, this crate
  will use rdrand as source of randomness, which may have a backdoor.
  This looks fine on other platforms, using built-in operating system
  CSPRNG generation functions, assuming the operating system vendors didn't
  screw up those functions - and if they did, you have a problem, whatever
  or not this crate is secure.
